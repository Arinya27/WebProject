      <p>Pizzeria was started as a small diner in May 24, 2011. Pizzeria has taken the best of Italian cooking - complex flavors, abundant variety and delicious slow cooked recipes and is delivering it to you in a familiar form made to order pizza's to enjoy at our restaurant, at work or your home.

Each pizza starts with delicately spiced and marinated fillings like Chicken to Cheese , then we add pickled onions, fresh cut veggies or cilantro chutney and finally wrap it all up for you in a flaky flatbread.

Our menu continues to evolve and gain inspiration from Italy but you can be sure to find popular Breakfast, Lunch & Dinner and the recently launched Unwrapped Salad (delicious fillings over a bed of salad) plus a variety of Italian drinks

So what are you waiting for, join us today for some fresh, Italian food, fast.</p>
