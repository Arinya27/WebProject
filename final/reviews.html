      <blockquote>The food is average Italian fair, I mean after all how much can you do with sauce and noodles...just kidding. The food is wonderful, large plates, sinful bread with garlic and olive oil dipping sauce, and dessert that are nothing short of lavish. The decor is understated but still grand. Lovely music playing just softly in the back ground. </blockquote>
